# dll_injector
simple dll injector. currently very ugly and hard to read code, will clean up later



usage(make nice later):

1. dll_injector.exe <list> : will list all pids
2. dll_injector.exe <pid> <file.exe> : will return pid of running exe
3. dll_injector.exe <pid> <payload.dll> : will inject into process
